# ME5406P1-Frozen-lake-Reinforcement-Learning
This project explore three reinforcement learnings method to solve the 4x4 Frozen Lake problem on OpenAI gym and it's variation with a 10x10 grid. 

Three reinforcement learning methods used in this projects are

* First Visit MonteCarlo Control without Exploring Start
* SARSA
* Q-learning

All results of the three methods are displayed with heatmap shown below
